Yet Another PixInsight script for GraXpert.

Script is compatible with GradXtractAI, a derivate version of GraXpert providing additional features
- Work with native PixInsight file formal XISF.
- Output of the background model.
- Better display of GraXpert errors in PixInsight console.

I'll adapt this script as soon as GraXpert will bring new features.

Any problem must be reported here.
